# bootstrap-portfolio

https://dee1985.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/

It's been a challenging (but exciting start to a new chapter in my life). This porfolio is my first project and it won't be my last.

It's been quite a rollercoaster and a tad of a throw back to my younger years in college- it's hard to not be on top anymore in my chosen career. But, there's always room to grow and there's no growth without struggle. I look forward to learning and utilizing more tools in addition to HTML and CSS throughout my learning adventure.

Bootstrap has shown to be useful if used with intention. It was difficult for me to not just customize everything. I initially started the project doing this in my zeal of wanting to use the knowledge I had acuired the previous week. I quite forgot that Bootstrap utilizes flex already! I spent a lot of time and energy trying to fix miniscule things, when I really should have just let Bootsrap "do its thang." 
 ** pearls of wisdom: in regards to a customized css (dimensions), less is really more.
